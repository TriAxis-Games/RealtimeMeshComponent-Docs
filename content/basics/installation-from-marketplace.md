You can purchase the RMC on the [Unreal Engine Marketplace!](https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/product/runtime-mesh-component)

Installing the Realtime Mesh Component from the Unreal Engine Marketplace is as simple as purchasing the plugin, and installing it to your current engine like any other plugin.

From here if you'd like to use the RMC from C++ code, you simple need to add `RealtimeMeshComponent` to your `.Build.cs` file like any other module you intend to use from C++.
